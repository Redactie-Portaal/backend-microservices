This document will explain what every folder does in the services and the structure of the folders.

Controllers -> Contains all handeling for HTTP requests, and the HTTP error handling
Data -> Contains the databaseContext and the Repositories. Everything database related
DTOs -> Contains the data transfer objects, example: UserDTO contains only email and username and not the entire User class.
Entities -> Contains the entities like User, these are exact replica's of the database classes.
Interfaces -> interface classes
Services -> Contains the methods meant for checks on DTOs and variables, example check if field is empty.

The current data structure is like this. Controller method call, to Services which checks the received data for faults, then
the repository which will do the database handling and checks, back to controller to finish the HTTP call.
