# GitHub workflows

This folder contains templates for different GitHub workflows, which can be used for adding workflows to new microservices. <br>
The templates contain placeholder text with three @@@, which need to be replaced with the specific information of the service. <br><br>

The current templates that are available:
* build and testing a microservice
* running SonarQube on a microservice.
